- `instagrapi` library (for interacting with Instagram)

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navtej968/bs.git
cd bs
pip install -r requirements.txt


**Note** Create a requirements.txt file including pollination and instagrapi or install them directly using:

```bash
Copy code
pip install pollination instagrapi


**Configuration**
Pollination AI
Ensure you have valid API credentials for Pollination AI. You may need to set up an account and generate an API key.

Instagram
Configure your Instagram credentials in a secure manner. Use environment variables or a configuration file to keep your login details private.

Usage
Run the script by executing:

```bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will generate a piece of art using Pollination AI and upload it to your Instagram account.

Script Explanation
Imports and Setup
python
Copy code
import os
from pollination_client import PollinationClient
from instagrapi import Client
os is used for environment variable management.
pollination_client is used to communicate with Pollination AI's API.
instagrapi is the library used for uploading to Instagram.
Setting Up Pollination API
python
Copy code
pollination_api_key = os.getenv("POLLINATION_API_KEY")
client = PollinationClient(api_key=pollination_api_key)
The POLLINATION_API_KEY should be set as an environment variable for security.
Generating Art
python
Copy code
image = client.generate_art(prompt="A beautiful sunset over mountains")
Replace "A beautiful sunset over mountains" with your desired art prompt.
Uploading to Instagram
python
Copy code
instagram_user = os.getenv("INSTAGRAM_USER")
instagram_password = os.getenv("INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD")

cl = Client()
cl.login(instagram_user, instagram_password)
cl.photo_upload('path/to/generated_image.jpg', caption='Check out my new artwork!')
The INSTAGRAM_USER and INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD should also be set as environment variables.
Customization
Art Parameters: Modify the script to customize the type, style, or specifics of the generated art.
Scheduling: Integrate with a task scheduler (e.g., cron jobs) for periodic uploads.
Security and Privacy
Keep your API keys and login credentials secure and do not share them in public repositories.
Use environment variables or a .env file for better security practices.
